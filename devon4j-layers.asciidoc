= devon4j component layers

As we already mentioned in the link:devon4j-overview.asciidoc#devon4j-architecture-overview[introduction to devon4j] the components of our _Java_ backend apps will be divided in three layers: _service_, _logic_ and _dataaccess_.

* _Service_ Layer: will contain the REST services to exchange information with the client applications.

* _Logic_ Layer: the layer in charge of hosting the logic of the application (validations, authorization control, business logic, etc.).

* _Data Access_ Layer: the layer to communicate with the data base.


== Layers implementation

Following the https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/wiki/guide-dependency-injection[devon4j recommendations] for _Dependency Injection_ in MyThaiStar's layers we will find:

- Separation of API and implementation: Inside each layer we will separate the elements in different packages: _api_ and _impl_. The _api_ will store the _interface_ with the methods definition and inside the _impl_ we will store the class that implements the _interface_.

image::images/devon4j/5.Layers/layer_api_impl.png[, link="images/devon4j/5.Layers/layer_api_impl.png"]

- Usage of JSR330: The Java standard set of annotations for _dependency injection_ (`@Named`, `@Inject`, `@PostConstruct`, `@PreDestroy`, etc.) provides us with all the needed annotations to define our beans and inject them.

[source, java]
----
@Named
public class MyBeanImpl implements MyBean {
  @Inject
  private MyOtherBean myOtherBean;

  @PostConstruct
  public void init() {
    // initialization if required (otherwise omit this method)
  }

  @PreDestroy
  public void dispose() {
    // shutdown bean, free resources if required (otherwise omit this method)
  }
}
----

=== Communication between layers

The communication between layers is solved using the described _Dependency Injection_ pattern, based on _Spring_ and the _Java_ standards: _java.inject_ (JSR330) combined with JSR250.

==== Service layer - Logic layer
[source,java]
----
import javax.inject.Inject;
import javax.inject.Named;

import io.oasp.application.mtsj.bookingmanagement.logic.api.Bookingmanagement;

@Named("BookingmanagementRestService")
public class BookingmanagementRestServiceImpl implements BookingmanagementRestService {

  @Inject
  private Bookingmanagement bookingmanagement;

  @Override
  public BookingCto getBooking(long id) {
    return this.bookingmanagement.findBooking(id);
  }

  ...

}
----

==== Logic layer - Data Access layer

[source,java]
----
import javax.inject.Inject;
import javax.inject.Named;

import io.oasp.application.mtsj.bookingmanagement.dataaccess.api.dao.BookingDao;

@Named
public class BookingmanagementImpl extends AbstractComponentFacade implements Bookingmanagement {

  @Inject
  private BookingDao bookingDao;

  @Override
  public boolean deleteBooking(Long bookingId) {

    BookingEntity booking = this.bookingDao.find(bookingId);
    this.bookingDao.delete(booking);
    return true;
  }

  ...

}
----


=== Service layer

As we mentioned at the beginning, the _Service_ layer is where the services of our application (REST or SOAP) will be located.

In _devon4j_ applications the default implementation for web services is based on http://cxf.apache.org/[Apache CXF], a services framework for Java apps that supports web service standards like _SOAP_ (implementing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_API_for_XML_Web_Services[JAX-WS]) and _REST_ services (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_API_for_RESTful_Web_Services[JAX-RS]).

In this tutorial we are going to focus only in the _REST_ implementation of the services.

==== Service definition

The services definition is done by the service _interface_ located in the `service.api.rest` package. In the _boooking_ component of _My Thai Star_ application we can see a service definition statement like the following


[source,java]
----
@Path("/bookingmanagement/v1")
@Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
public interface BookingmanagementRestService {

  @GET
  @Path("/booking/{id}/")
  public BookingCto getBooking(@PathParam("id") long id);

  ...

}
----

*JAX-RS annotations*:

- _@Path_: defines the common path for all the resources of the service.

- _@Consumes_ and _@Produces_: declares the type of data that the service expects to receive from the client and the type of data that will return to the client as response.

- _@GET_: annotation for _HTTP_ _get_ method.

- _@Path_: the path definition for the _getBooking_ resource.

- _@PathParam_: annotation to configure the _id_ received in the _url_ as a parameter.




==== Service implementation

The service implementation is a class located in the `service.impl.rest` package that implements the previous defined interface.

[source,java]
----
@Named("BookingmanagementRestService")
public class BookingmanagementRestServiceImpl implements BookingmanagementRestService {

  @Inject
  private Bookingmanagement bookingmanagement;

  @Override
  public BookingCto getBooking(long id) {

    return this.bookingmanagement.findBooking(id);
  }

  ...
}
----

As you can see this layer simply delegates in the _logic_ layer to resolve the app requirements regarding business logic.

=== Logic layer

In this layer we will store all the custom implementations to resolve the requirements of our applications. Including:

- business logic.

- Delegation of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_transaction_management[transaction management] to Spring framework.

- object mappings.

- validations.

- authorizations.

Within the _logic_ layer we must avoid including code related to services or data access, we must delegate those tasks in the suitable layer.


==== Logic layer definition

As in the _service_ layer, the logic implementation will be defined by an interface located in a `logic.api` package.

[source,java]
----
public interface Bookingmanagement {

  BookingCto findBooking(Long id);

  ...
}
----

==== Logic layer implementation

In a `logic.impl` package a _Impl_ class will implement the interface of the previous section.

[source,java]
----
@Named
@Transactional
public class BookingmanagementImpl extends AbstractComponentFacade implements Bookingmanagement {

  /**
   * Logger instance.
   */
  private static final Logger LOG = LoggerFactory.getLogger(BookingmanagementImpl.class);

  /**
   * @see #getBookingDao()
   */
  @Inject
  private BookingDao bookingDao;

  /**
   * The constructor.
   */
  public BookingmanagementImpl() {

    super();
  }

  @Override
  public BookingCto findBooking(Long id) {

    LOG.debug("Get Booking with id {} from database.", id);
    BookingEntity entity = getBookingDao().findOne(id);
    BookingCto cto = new BookingCto();
    cto.setBooking(getBeanMapper().map(entity, BookingEto.class));
    cto.setOrder(getBeanMapper().map(entity.getOrder(), OrderEto.class));
    cto.setInvitedGuests(getBeanMapper().mapList(entity.getInvitedGuests(), InvitedGuestEto.class));
    cto.setOrders(getBeanMapper().mapList(entity.getOrders(), OrderEto.class));
    return cto;
  }

  public BookingDao getBookingDao() {
    return this.bookingDao;
  }

  ...
}
----

In the above _My Thai Star_ logic layer example we can see:

- business logic and/or https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/wiki/guide-beanmapping[object mappings].

- Delegation of the transaction management through the Spring's `@Transactional` annotation.

=== Transfer objects

In the code examples of the _logic_ layer section you may have seen a _BookingCto_ object. This is one of the https://github.com/devonfw/devon4j/wiki/guide-transferobject[Transfer Objects] defined in _devon4j_ to be used as transfer data element between layers.

Main benefits of using _TO's_:

- Avoid inconsistent data (when entities are sent across the app changes tend to take place in multiple places).

- Define how much data to transfer (relations lead to transferring too much data).

- Hide internal details.

In _devon4j_ we can find two different _Transfer Objects:

==== Entity Transfer Object (ETO)

- Same data-properties as entity.

- No relations to other entities.

- Simple and solid mapping.

==== Composite Transfer Object(CTO)

- No data-properties at all.

- Only relations to other TOs.

- 1:1 as reference, else Collection(List) of TOs.

- Easy to manually map reusing ETO's and CTO's.


=== Data Access layer

The third, and last, layer of the _devon4j_ architecture is the one responsible for store all the code related to connection and access to data base.

For mapping java objects to the data base _devon4j_ use the http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/tech/persistence-jsp-140049.html[Java Persistence API(JPA)]. And as _JPA_ implementation _devon4j_ use http://hibernate.org/orm/[hibernate].

Apart from the _Entities_ of the component, in the _dataaccess_ layer we are going to find the same elements that we saw in the other layers: definition (an _interface_) and implementation (a class that implements that interface).

However, in this layer the implementation is slightly different, the `[Target]DaoImpl` extends `general.dataaccess.base.dao.ApplicationDaoImpl` that provides us (through `io.oasp.module.jpa`) with the basic implementation _dataaccess_ methods: `save(Entity)`, `findOne(id)`, `findAll(ids)`, `delete(id)`, etc.

Because of that, in the `[Target]DaoImpl` implementation of the layer we only need to add the _custom_ methods that are not implemented yet. Following the _My Thai Star_ component example (_bookingmanagement_) we will find only the paginated _findBookings_ implementation.

==== Data Access layer definition

[source,java]
----
public interface BookingDao extends ApplicationDao<BookingEntity> {
  PaginatedListTo<BookingEntity> findBookings(BookingSearchCriteriaTo criteria);
}
----

==== Data Access layer implementation

[source,java]
----
@Named
public class BookingDaoImpl extends ApplicationDaoImpl<BookingEntity> implements BookingDao {

  @Override
  public PaginatedListTo<BookingEntity> findBookings(BookingSearchCriteriaTo criteria) {

    BookingEntity booking = Alias.alias(BookingEntity.class);
    EntityPathBase<BookingEntity> alias = Alias.$(booking);
    JPAQuery query = new JPAQuery(getEntityManager()).from(alias);

    ...

  }
}
----

The implementation of the _findBookings_ uses http://www.querydsl.com/[queryDSL] to manage the dynamic queries.
