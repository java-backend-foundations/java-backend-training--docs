== Preparation

Before beginning the labs, please complete the link:preparation.asciidoc[Preparation] steps to ensure your environment is ready.

== Training Modules

The training is structured to help you build the _Task Service_ in layers, progressing from setup to business logic, service integration, and security. Follow the modules below in sequence:

. link:task-service-setup.asciidoc[Setup]: Set up the foundational elements needed to start working on the Task Service application.
. link:task-service.asciidoc[Task Service]: Understand the purpose of the Task Service and the key features it will provide.
. link:task-service-dataaccess-layer.asciidoc[Data Access Layer]: Define the database schema and create the entities for the data access layer.
. link:task-service-logic-layer.asciidoc[Business Logic Layer]: Implement the core business logic for managing tasks and related operations.
. link:task-service-services-layer.asciidoc[Services Layer]: Integrate services and configure interaction points within the application.
. link:task-service-security.asciidoc[Security]: Apply security best practices to protect sensitive data and restrict access to authorized users.


== Additional Notes

Throughout these labs, you will gain hands-on experience with Java backend principles, including data persistence, business logic encapsulation, service-oriented architecture, and application security.
